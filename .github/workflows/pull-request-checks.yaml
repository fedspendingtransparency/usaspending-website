# Only allow a single run of the PR checks for each branch. This means that in the case of multiple
# PRs opened from a single branch into multiple others (e.g., hotfixes) a single run of the PR checks
# will occur. However, additional runs of the PR checks will be triggered when the source branch
# is re-synced with the target branch.
