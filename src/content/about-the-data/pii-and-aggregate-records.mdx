Aggregate records are used to avoid reporting the recipient's
personally identifiable information (PII) when a financial
assistance award is made to an individual. The concept of PII does
not apply to organizations, whose federal awards must be reported in
non-aggregate form.

Aggregation involves grouping awards to individuals (typically from
the same program and time period) by county (for domestic awards),
state (for domestic awards), or country (for foreign awards). These
records omit location information that would normally be present
(e.g., street address and the last 4 digits of the ZIP code) and
replace the recipient name with "MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS." The award 
profile pages for these records specify the level of
aggregation. The Unique Record Identifier (URI) serves as the
identification code for aggregate records, in contrast to the
Financial Assistance Identification Number (FAIN) used for
non-aggregate records.

awards containing PII, please refer to
