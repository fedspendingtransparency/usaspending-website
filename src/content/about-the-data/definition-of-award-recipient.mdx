Federal law requires that information about an entity that receives
a federal award be published on USAspending.gov, including amounts
of federal funding the entity received
 (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:31%20section:6101%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title31-section6101)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true">31 U.S.C. § 6101 note</a>)
 These entities are defined in law as for-profit or non-profit legal
business or state/local governmental entities, and they exclude
federal employees and individual recipients of federal assistance.
Government programs administering federal awards may have further
requirements for what types of entities are eligible. Entities are
identified on USAspending.gov by a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)
code.

Although USAspending.gov does publish information about awards to individual persons, this information is either aggregated or redacted to prevent publication of personally identifiable information (PII). For more information about reporting requirements for financial assistance awards containing PII, please refer to the
