Effective for the June 2020 reporting period, agencies with COVID-19
relief funding were required to submit their financial data (i.e., Files A, B,
and C) to USAspending.gov on a monthly basis. These submissions had to
include outlays for each award in File C with a Disaster Emergency
Fund Code (DECF) domain value. This requirement affected most
agencies that submit regular financial reports to USAspending.gov.

Beginning in Fiscal Year 2022, all agencies are required to submit their 
financial data on a monthly basis, including outlay data for award spending. 
Any outlay data before this period were optional for agencies to report, and 
thus may be incomplete. New or updated data appear on USAspending.gov 
the day after they are submitted (i.e., published) by the agency.
