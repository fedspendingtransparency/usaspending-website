    To help users understand the variety of filters available on USAspending.gov, we have grouped filters by five main categories. Below you will see what filters are included in each category.
</div>

<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-header">About the Filter</div>
<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-section">
    Results are filtered by the source of the award, such as Awarding Agency <GlossaryLink term="awarding-agency"/>, Funding Agency <GlossaryLink term="funding-agency"/>,
    Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) <GlossaryLink term="treasury-account-symbol-tas"/>, or Disaster Emergency Fund Code (DEFC) <GlossaryLink term="disaster-emergency-fund-code-defc"/>.

<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-section">
    Treasury and OMB assign a code to each appropriation, receipt, or fund account to help identify financial transactions <GlossaryLink term="transaction"/> in the federal government.

    Please note: Unlinked awards <GlossaryLink term="unlinked-award"/> are not associated with a TAS code and may not appear in search results.
</div>

<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-header">A note about our TAS data sources</div>
<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-section">
    This filter uses Account Breakdown by Award <GlossaryLink term="account-breakdown-by-award-file-c"/> data; this data only covers award transactions that occurred after January 2017. Awards that began prior to January 2017 will only show up in search results if they have financial modifications after January 2017.

    A subset of agency-submitted Account Breakdown by Award data is not definitively linkable to a single Federal Award; unlinked data cannot be and is not used by this filter, but is available along with the rest of the Account Breakdown by Award Data in the Custom Account Data section.
</div>

<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-header"> Disaster Emergency Fund Codes (DEFC) Search</div>
<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-section">
    Disaster Emergency Fund Code (DEFC) is an accounting attribute used to track the spending of supplemental funding for disasters and emergencies such as COVID-19. Each code corresponds to one or more legislative bills that authorized the funding.
