The USAspending data reflect obligations to a single entity that is processing payments on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Coronavirus/Overview">The full Provider Relief Fund Public Use File is posted here</a>.
This Public Use file is updated weekly and includes payments under the General Distribution including Medicare, Medicaid/CHIP, Dental, Assisted Living Facilities, and Behavioral Health/other providers; and targeted allocations to high impact areas, safety net hospitals, children's hospitals, rural providers, tribal facilities, and skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes. Payments are made at the Tax Identification Number (TIN) organizational level. The Public Use dataset represents the list of providers who have attested to receiving one or more payments from the aforementioned allocations and agreed to Terms and Conditions. Because not all providers (who in many cases received a payment unsolicited) have yet to attest to accepting that payment, the totals listed for this program in the Public Use File are less than those reflected on USAspending.gov.
