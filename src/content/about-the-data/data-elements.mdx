The data in award search come primarily from governmentwide award systems in formats called File D1 (for contract award elements) and File D2 (for financial assistance award elements). If a filter is not listed below, then it applies to both contract and financial assistance award elements. 

Filters for agency account elements apply to both contract and financial assistance award elements, but they come from File C (award data from agency financial systems that are submitted directly to USAspending.gov) rather than from Files D1 or D2. 

Contract Award Elements 

Contract award elements contain information from a governmentwide award system called the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This information is extracted by USAspending.gov in a format called File D1. 

Filters that draw exclusively from contract award elements are: 

- North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
- Product or Service Code (PSC)
- Type of Contract Pricing 
- Type of Set Aside
- Extent Competed 

Financial Assistance Award Elements 

Financial assistance award elements contain information from a governmentwide award system called the Financial Assistance Broker System (FABS). This information is submitted directly to USAspending.gov in a format called File D2. 

The filter that draws exclusively from financial assistance award elements is: 

- Assistance Listing (CFDA Program)

Agency Account Elements 

Agency account elements contain information from agency financial systems, and includes information about federal awards in a format called File C. Data in File C complement data in Files D1 and D2, which come from governmentwide award systems. If you select a filter that draws from agency account elements, then these data must be linked to data in governmentwide award systems before any results can be displayed. (The reverse is not true: you may see results from governmentwide award systems that are not linked to data in agency account elements.) 

Filters that draw exclusively from agency account elements are: 

- Treasury Account Symbol (TAS)
- Disaster Emergency Fund Code (DEFC)
