The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by federal agencies to classify business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. 

This six-digit code tells you what industry the work falls into. Each contract record has a NAICS code. USAspending.gov updates NAICS codes every five years. 

Usaspending.gov uses NAICS codes to enhance the organization and accessibility of spending data. For example, these codes are used in Advanced Search filters, allowing users to navigate spending information by specific industry categories. NAICS codes also appear on various profile pages, such as those for award recipients and states, providing a hierarchical view that describes funding by sector.  

USAspending.gov receives NAICS codes by extracting a collection of data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) known as file D1. For more information about what is included in these extractions, please consult the Interface Definition Document (IDD) spreadsheet in the  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/data-transparency/GSDM-current.html#fed">Governmentwide Spending Data Model (GSDM)</a> page.
