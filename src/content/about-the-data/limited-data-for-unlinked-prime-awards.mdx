Prime award data on USAspending.gov come from two types of
sources: agency financial systems (whose data are submitted in
File C) and governmentwide award systems (whose data are extracted in Files
D1 and D2). These two source types provide complementary data about
federal awards. Complete information about any given award is only
possible if that award is \"linked\" across the two source types
through a common award identifier (also known as a "prime award
unique key").

If an award appears in agency financial systems but NOT in governmentwide
award systems, then it will lack information such as recipient,
location, industry, contract competition, and assistance listing (CFDA program).

On the other hand, if an award appears in governmentwide award systems but NOT
in agency financial systems, then it will lack information such as
treasury account symbol (TAS), program activity, object class, disaster emergency
fund code (DEFC), and outlays.

In additional to a missing common award identifier, an award may also be unlinked if any of the following apply:

-   The award has no activity after Fiscal Year 2017 Quarter 2.

-   The award is a loan with zero or negative subsidy cost.

-   The award is under the micropurchase threshold, and the agency
    reports it in File C but not File D1/D2, or vice versa.

Awards" section on this
