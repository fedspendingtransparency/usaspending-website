The COVID-19 Spending Profile shows you summary information for
COVID-19 pandemic relief spending, as funded by supplemental
appropriations bills (such as the CARES Act) and identified by
Disaster Emergency Fund Codes (DEFC). This feature is powered by
**Files B and C** for the DEFC spending figures at the agency
account level and the award level, the **Governmentwide Treasury
Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS)** for
high-level DEFC spending figures, and **Files D1 and D2** for
award and recipient details. Data from **File E** (for executive
compensation) and **File F** (for subawards) are available in
the download for this profile.
