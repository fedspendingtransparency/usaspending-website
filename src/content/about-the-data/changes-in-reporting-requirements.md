Since 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued
multiple guidance documents for reporting federal spending data, and
the addition of new guidance and requirements affects the
completeness, consistency, and quality of specific data elements
over time. More recent fiscal years tend to have higher quality
spending data than older fiscal years.
