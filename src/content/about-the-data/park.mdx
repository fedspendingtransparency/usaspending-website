The Appendix to the Presidentâ€™s Budget (PB) outlines yearly agency spending
plans. In an effort to standardize program activity reporting to align with the PB,
the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/">
Office of Management and Budget</a> has introduced a unique identifier: Program
Activity Reporting Key (PARK). Beginning in Fiscal Year 2026, PARK will replace the
existing Program Activity Code (PAC) and Program Activity Name (PAN) for tracking
program activities and enhancing the accuracy and consistency of data across
federal agencies.

they are organized by OMB Fund Families. This structured approach ensures that
PARK codes correspond to specific activities or projects detailed in the program
and financing schedules of the annual United States Government budget.
