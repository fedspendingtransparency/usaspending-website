Previously, the unique award key was generated using a combination of the following elements:

-	FAIN: Federal Award Identification Number

-	URI: Unique Record Identifier

-	AwardSubTierAgencyCode

However, on July 4, 2025, a change was implemented to enhance the generation of the unique award key for financial assistance awards. The new methodology now derives the unique award key by concatenating the following elements:

-	FAIN: Federal Award Identification Number

-	URI: Unique Record Identifier

-	AwardingAgencyCode

Although duplicates may still arise due to other issues, this update enhances the accuracy and completeness of the displayed transactions and awards data, preventing the double counting of awards.

Key Changes: 

-	Unique award keys are now generated by grouping top-tier award agencies instead of sub-agencies, further enhancing data integrity and completeness.

-	This updated methodology ensures that transactions are now more accurately linked to their corresponding financial assistance awards, facilitating improved reporting and display outputs.
