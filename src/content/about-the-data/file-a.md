File A (Account Balances) is part of the package of data submitted
to USAspending.gov every month by federal agencies via the DATA Act
Broker, as required by the DATA Act. As part of the monthly
submission process, agencies may use the DATA Act Broker to generate
File A automatically from data in the Governmentwide Treasury
Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS), or choose to upload
their own custom File A data. File A contains budgetary resources,
obligation, and outlay data for all the relevant Treasury Account Symbols (TAS)
in a reporting agency. It includes both award and non-award spending
(grouped together), and crosswalks with the SF 133 report.
