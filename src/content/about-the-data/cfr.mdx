The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification of the
general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the
executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The
following three sections of Title 2 of the CFR cover key policy
requirements for financial assistance awards that relate to
USAspending.gov. 

- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-I/part-25">2 CFR §
  25</a> requires that recipients and subrecipients obtain a unique entity
    identifier (UEI) by fully registering in SAM.gov before they may do
    business with the government, outlines a few exceptions to this
    policy, details how agencies should report data to USAspending.gov
    using a generic UEI when one of these exceptions applies, and
    provides the award term language that agencies must use to enshrine
    these requirements to relevant recipients.

- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-I/part-170">2 CFR §
  170</a> requires that recipients report subawards, executive compensation
    information, and subaward executive compensation information (to
    FSRS.gov, SAM.gov, and FSRS.gov, respectively) outside of certain
    exceptions, as well as provides award term language that agencies
    must use to enshrine these requirements to the relevant recipients. 

- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200">2 CFR §
  200</a> covers the basic FFATA reporting requirements and specifies a
    specific set of information that must be captured in every federal
    award.
