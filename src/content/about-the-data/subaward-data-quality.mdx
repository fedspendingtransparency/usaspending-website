Subaward data are currently submitted by prime recipients of federal awards (specifically,
contracts and grants, including cooperative agreements) to
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.SAM.gov/">SAM.gov</a>)
(the previous system, FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), was retired on March 8, 2025),
which is operated by the General Services Administration (GSA). Effective November 2020, the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-I/part-170/subpart-A/section-170.105">2 CFR ยง 170.105</a>
to expand the subaward reporting requirements to other types of financial assistance beyond grants
and cooperative agreements, such as direct payments (direct appropriations), loans, subsidies,
and insurance; however, as of August 2022, SAM.gov has not been updated to allow for reporting
of these other assistance types.

While federal agency personnel do not submit subaward data themselves,
they are required to ensure that the award terms and conditions for
any federal award include specific language requiring subaward
reporting (subject to certain exceptions listed in
 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-I/part-170/subpart-A/section-170.110">2 CFR ยง 170.110</a>);
 moreover, agencies are responsible for enforcement and
oversight of award terms and conditions. In practice, agency internal
controls and practices vary widely with regard to monitoring and
ensuring compliance with subaward data reporting.

There are several documented issues related to subaward data quality
that users should be aware of:

-   Duplication of subaward records is common. Prime recipients often
    re-report data covering all subawards they have issued to date under
    a prime award, even though they should only report subaward actions
    that occurred in the specific month in question. When this happens,
    the duplicate data flow to USAspending.gov as if they were new data.
    This kind of re-reporting can lead to substantial duplication of
    data for these prime recipients and result in excessively large
    subaward amounts which sometimes exceed the prime award amount. Note
    that when the migration from FSRS to SAM.gov occurred in March 2025,
    additional controls were put into place that should prevent duplication
    for subaward records going forward.

-   While subawards have not been subject to comprehensive audit
    attention as of August 2022, oversight bodies such as the Pandemic Response
    Accountability Committee (PRAC) have
 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pandemicoversight.gov/media/file/increasing-transparency-covid-19-spending10192021pdf">noted</a>
    that subawards are inconsistently reported under the same federal
    programs. For example, certain states publish subaward data on their
    own websites, but do not submit these data to SAM.gov. Additionally,
    GAO has found that: subaward records are sometimes submitted after the
    required reporting deadline, subaward descriptions are sometimes inconsistent
    with the data standards established under OMB guidance and sometimes contain
    missing or incorrectly transcribed values for data fields.
