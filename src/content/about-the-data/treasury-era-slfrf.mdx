Subaward data for the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) and State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) programs are not available in the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sam.gov">SAM.gov</a>) because this system currently only supports subgrant reporting for financial assistance, and ERA and SLFRF awards are direct payments rather than grants. As such, these subaward data are also not integrated into USAspending subaward data, since USAspending subaward data are currently sourced exclusively from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sam.gov">SAM.gov</a>. In consequence and for transparency purposes, the Department of the Treasury is publishing and updating these data separately from USAspending.gov, but is including links to them here and on the USAspending COVID Spending profile page (in the ‘Other Resources’ section). These files will be updated as additional data are collected, with the last updated date noted in the XLSX file.
