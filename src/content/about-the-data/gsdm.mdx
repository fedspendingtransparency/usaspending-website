The Governmentwide Spending Data Model (GSDM) lays out the technical
requirements that federal agencies must conform to when submitting
data to USAspending.gov. GSDM reflects all relevant requirements and
deadlines in OMB memos and is consistent with the policies they lay
out. Federal agencies should generally not need to reference these
memos to understand their FFATA/DATA Act submission responsibilities
or GSDM requirements.
