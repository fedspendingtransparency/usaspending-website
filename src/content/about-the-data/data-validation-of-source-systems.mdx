The DATA Act Broker validates the data it receives from agency financial systems
 (Files A, B, and C) as well as the Treasury Financial Assistance Broker 
 Submission (FABS) system. These validations are based on business rules 
 (such as for award linkage between File C and Files D1 and D2) and checks 
 against authoritative sources such as GTAS. Agency financial systems are subject 
 to other data quality assurance measures, such as review by Offices of Inspector
  General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for reports as 
  required by the DATA Act.

USAspending.gov relies on internal validations of data within source systems 
outside of the Treasury Department (such as FPDS, FSRS, and  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://sam.gov/" alt="sam.gov link">SAM.gov</a>). 
The data extracted from these systems may not always align with the data 
standards, definitions, and requirements established in guidance from the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Treasury Department.
