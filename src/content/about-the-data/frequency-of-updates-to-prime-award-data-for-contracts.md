Contract data from the [Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS)](https://www.fpds.gov/) are generally available on
USAspending.gov within five days of when a contract award or
modification is made. Procurement policy allows contracting officers
three business days to submit a contract action report to FPDS;
after they do so, those data are made available to USAspending.gov
on the following morning and automatically published to the website
the day after that.

-   Example 1: A contract award or modification is made on a given
    Thursday. The award is reported to FPDS three business days
    later, on the following Tuesday. It is then made available to
    USAspending.gov on Wednesday morning and published to the site
    on Thursday.

-   Example 2: A contract award or modification is made on a given
    Tuesday. The award is reported to FPDS three business days
    later, on Friday. It is then made available to USAspending.gov
    on Saturday morning and published to the site on Sunday.

There are two exceptions to the three-business-day rule for contract data from FPDS:

-   Publication of Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. Army Corps of
    Engineers (USACE) data in FPDS is delayed 90 days.

-   As per procurement regulation [(Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.604)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/4.604), any contract
    award made in accordance with the [FAR 6.302-2](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/6.302-2#FAR_6_302_2), or
    pursuant to any of the authorities listed in the [FAR subpart 18.2](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-18.2#FAR_Subpart_18_2), must be submitted to FPDS within 30 days of the contract award.
