The USAspending data reflect obligations to a single entity that is 
processing payments on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Coronavirus/Overview">The full Rural Health Clinic (RHC) Testing Fund Public Use File is posted here</a>.
This file is updated weekly and includes payments to RHCs for COVID-19 testing.
Payments are made at the Tax Identification Number (TIN)
organizational level. This dataset represents the list of providers
who have attested to receiving a payment from the aforementioned
allocation and agreed to the Terms and Conditions. Because not all
providers (who received a payment unsolicited) have yet to attest to
accepting that payment, the totals listed for this program in the
Public Use File are less than those reflected on USAspending.gov.
