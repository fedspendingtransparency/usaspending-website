<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-header">About the Filter </div>
<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-section"> 
    Search results can be filtered by action date <GlossaryLink term="action-date"/> (for example, the date of the most recent transaction or the base transaction action date <GlossaryLink term="base-transaction-action-date"/> or the period of performance (the projected date range in which the work occurs)).  

    Individual transactions <GlossaryLink term="transaction" /> for any single award summary result may not exist within the selected time period. 

    Transaction results in the Time, Map, and Categories tables will fall within the selected time period based on the action date <GlossaryLink term="action-date" />. 

    Search results filtered by action date include all awards within the selected time period, even if there are no new transactions. For example, for the selected time period of Mar. 1-31, 2022, you would see results in the Table tab for an award with a base transaction action date of Jan. 1, 2022 and a latest transaction action date of Dec. 31, 2022, even if there is no transaction activity for that award within the period of Mar. 1-31, 2022.

<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-header">Show New Awards Only </div>
<div className="collapsible-sidebar--dsm-wrapper--text-section"> 
    Selecting the “Show New Awards Only” checkbox will display any prime award <GlossaryLink term="prime-award"/> whose first transaction (base transaction action date) falls within the selected time period. 

    The "Show New Awards Only" filter does not apply to subawards <GlossaryLink term="sub-award" />. Since there is no concept of “sub-award modification” or “sub-award summary level” in the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) data model, all subawards are considered “new.”
