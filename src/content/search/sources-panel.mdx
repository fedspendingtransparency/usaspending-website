    This filter uses Account Breakdown by Award <GlossaryLink term="account-breakdown-by-award-file-c"/> data; this data only covers award transactions that occurred after January 2017. Awards that began prior to January 2017 will only show up in search results if they have financial modifications after January 2017. 
    
    A subset of agency-submitted Account Breakdown by Award data is not definitively linkable to a single Federal Award; unlinked data cannot be and is not used by this filter, but is available along with the rest of the Account Breakdown by Award Data in the Custom Account Data section.
