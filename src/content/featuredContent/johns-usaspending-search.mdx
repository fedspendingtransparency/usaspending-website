In our [Your Data, Your Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqGDGY2Qzko) video, John shares insights on how spending flows from an awarding agency down to a specific institution or partner. USAspending’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer">Spending Explorer</a> offers three ways to view this data.

1. [Budget Function](https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/budget_function): View spending grouped by a given topic, such as Natural Resources and Environment
2. [Agency](https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/agency): View spending grouped by federal agency, such as Department of Transportation
3. [Object Class](https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/object_class): View spending grouped by the types of items and services purchased by the federal government, such as personnel compensation and benefits

Following the money from the <GlossaryLink term="awarding-agency" label="awarding agency" /> down to an individual grant or contract helps users see relationships and dependencies in federal spending. 

In his testimonial, John discusses how he used data from USAspending.gov to create a model of all the spending dependencies tied to a specific <GlossaryLink term="naics" label="NAICS" /> code.  

> “So that allowed for the creation of a network from an awarding agency all the way through a prime contractor and into the supplier that allowed us to understand the supply dependencies within that specific NAICS code.”
