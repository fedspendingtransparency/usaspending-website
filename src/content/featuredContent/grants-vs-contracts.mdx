## A Storybook Example 

Let’s say you’re a part of a company that builds brick houses for little pigs. You might receive funding from your local government as part of a grant to build wolf-proof houses in your area; you don’t have to pay this money back. But your company might also enter into a service contract with the federal government to advise on better techniques for building wolf-proof houses in heavily forested, wolf-prone areas. In this case, the government would pay you in exchange for fulfilling the requirements outlined in the agreement.
