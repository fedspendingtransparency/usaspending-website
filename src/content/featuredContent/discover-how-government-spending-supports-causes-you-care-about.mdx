Here’s how you can use USAspending’s Advanced Search to track spending on the issues you care about:

## [Search by Keywords](#search-by-keywords)

## [Explore by Agency or Location](#explore-by-agency-or-location)

Use filters to narrow results by agency (like the Department of Defense or the Department of Health and Human Services) or by your state or county. This helps you understand how national spending priorities impact your local community.

## [Track Spending Over Time](#track-spending-over-time)

Search for spending data by period of performance or fiscal year. Select multiple options to view results over time and compare spending year-over-year.

## [Follow the Money to Recipients](#follow-the-money-to-recipients)

Each search result links to detailed profiles of recipients—whether it’s nonprofits, businesses, or universities—so you can see who’s receiving funding to do the work you care about.
