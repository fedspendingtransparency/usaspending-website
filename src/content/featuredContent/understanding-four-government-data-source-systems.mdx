## Source Systems 

### 1. Agency Budget Execution:  

Agency budget execution information (compiled in SF 133 reports) shows how agencies across the federal government spend their funding, as required by the [Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-11](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a11.pdf). Some agencies submit financial data directly to the Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS) but not to USAspending.gov; USAspending.gov extracts data from GTAS daily. 

### 2. Agency Financial Systems: 
Federal agencies maintain business systems to track their own finances, such as for operational costs, employee salaries, and spending for federal awards. Data from these systems are submitted directly to USAspending.gov in accordance with the DATA Act and guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. 

### 3. Governmentwide Award Systems: 
Agencies maintain detailed records of their federal awards in governmentwide award systems. These award systems track obligations for <GlossaryLink term="transaction" label="award transactions" />, as well as related data about federal awards such as recipients, locations, and purposes. Any individual award is composed of one or more transactions with a common <GlossaryLink term="award-id" label="award ID" />. 

Separate systems exist for  <GlossaryLink term="contract" label="contract awards" />,  <GlossaryLink term="financial-assistance" label="financial assistance awards" />,  <GlossaryLink term="sub-award" label="sub-awards" />, as well as recipient registration data. 

### 4. Additional Government Data: 
Certain agencies are considered authoritative sources for information related to the spending data that USAspending.gov publishes. USAspending.gov draws from these agencies' systems as needed to provide standardized names, codes, and element relationships.
