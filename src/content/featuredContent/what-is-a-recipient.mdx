On <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.usaspending.gov">USAspending.gov</a>, a recipient is a company, organization, individual, or government entity (i.e., state, local, tribal, federal, or foreign), that receives funding from the U.S. government.

Think of our open data like the government’s credit card statement: there’s both the dollar amount that’s been paid <GlossaryLink term="outlay" label="(outlays)" /> and the name of the entity that received the payment <GlossaryLink term="recipient" label="(recipient)" />. 

Understanding who the recipient is helps you to follow the money and see exactly how your tax dollars are being spent, right down to who received federal funding.
