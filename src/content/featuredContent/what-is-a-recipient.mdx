Whether you’re using our filters to refine your search query or viewing the prime award results table, recipients are a key component of USAspending data. But what is a recipient?

Think of our open data like the government’s credit card statement: there’s both the dollar amount that’s been paid <GlossaryLink term="outlay" label="(outlays)" /> and the name of the entity that received the payment <GlossaryLink term="recipient" label="(recipient)" />. 

Understanding who the recipient is helps you to follow the money and see exactly how your tax dollars are being spent, right down to who received federal funding. 

To learn more about the different types of recipients, visit the “Recipient Data Elements” section of the [Federal Spending Guide](https://www.usaspending.gov/federal-spending-guide).
