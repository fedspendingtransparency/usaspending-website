Drop us a comment below!\n\nCHAPTERS:\n\n0:00 Welcome!\n\n0:42 Appropriations\nAppropriation is a process by which Congress identifies and approves spending for a specific purpose. Without an appropriation, federal agencies won’t receive funding, and thus can’t spend money. \n\nFederal Account Profile Example: https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/075-0512\n\n1:48 Obligations\nObligations are binding agreements that agencies enter to spend budgetary resources on authorized purposes such as agency employee salaries or federal awards like contracts, grants, and loans. \n\n2:19 Outlays\nWhen the agency actually makes a payment, these payments are recorded as outlays. Outlays represent the official spending of funds that have been obligated. \n\nAgency Profile Example: https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-health-and-human-services?fy=2021\n\nAward Profile Example: https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75H70421F80001_7527_75FCMC18D0047_7530\n\n3:51 Thank you!\n\nLINKS:\n\n  •  Visit USAspending.gov: https://www.usaspending.gov/\n\n  •  Sign up for our email list to receive updates and release notes by sending an email to:\n      join-usaspending@lists.fiscal.treasury.gov\n\n  •  Ask questions about the tools, features, and data on USAspending.gov by sending an email to:\n      usaspending.help@fiscal.treasury.gov\n\n  •  Request customized training on USAspending.gov for your organization:\n      https://www.usaspending.gov/about?sec..\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!",

                    description: "Welcome to the first video in our series about the Data Sources page. Learn about important federal spending terminology and how to distinguish topline budget figures such as obligations and outlays! Explore the Data Sources page here: https://www.usaspending.gov/data-sources\n\nWe want to hear your ideas for future videos. Drop us a comment below!\n\nCHAPTERS:\n\n0:00 Welcome!\n\n0:42 Appropriations\nAppropriation is a process by which Congress identifies and approves spending for a specific purpose. Without an appropriation, federal agencies won’t receive funding, and thus can’t spend money. \n\nFederal Account Profile Example: https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/075-0512\n\n1:48 Obligations\nObligations are binding agreements that agencies enter to spend budgetary resources on authorized purposes such as agency employee salaries or federal awards like contracts, grants, and loans. \n\n2:19 Outlays\nWhen the agency actually makes a payment, these payments are recorded as outlays. Outlays represent the official spending of funds that have been obligated. \n\nAgency Profile Example: https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-health-and-human-services?fy=2021\n\nAward Profile Example: https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75H70421F80001_7527_75FCMC18D0047_7530\n\n3:51 Thank you!\n\nLINKS:\n\n  •  Visit USAspending.gov: https://www.usaspending.gov/\n\n  •  Sign up for our email list to receive updates and release notes by sending an email to:\n      join-usaspending@lists.fiscal.treasury.gov\n\n  •  Ask questions about the tools, features, and data on USAspending.gov by sending an email to:\n      usaspending.help@fiscal.treasury.gov\n\n  •  Request customized training on USAspending.gov for your organization:\n      https://www.usaspending.gov/about?sec..\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!"
