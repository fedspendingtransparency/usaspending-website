While the &quot;Award Summaries&quot; files in this download will be sufficient for most users, the File C data has two main uses: 1) it provides access to both <strong>linked and unlinked</strong> data used in award spending totals on this page (the &quot;Award Summaries&quot; files in the profile page download only contain <strong>linked</strong> data — see &quot;Linked and Unlinked Award Data&quot; below for more information); 2) it provides a higher degree of granularity in breaking down award spending by several financial data dimensions (including the specific amount each award was funded by each Object Class, Program Activity, Disaster Emergency Fund Code (DEFC), and Treasury Account).

                                            Loan Spending is more complicated than spending for other federal awards like contracts or grants. Loan spending has two components: 1) Face Value of Loans, which is the amount that agencies have directly issued (for direct loans) or facilitated by compensating the lender if the borrower defaults (for loan guarantees); and 2) Loan Subsidy Cost, which is the calculated net present value of the loan or loan guarantee to the government, taking into account the size of the loan (i.e., its face value), interest rate, and the modeled risk of the recipient failing to pay back the loan in part or full.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From a budget perspective, Face Value of Loans is not considered federal spending, since it does not in itself represent a long-term cost to the government. As a result, <strong>Face Value of Loans is not included in any obligation or outlay figure</strong>. However, <strong>Loan Subsidy Cost does have direct budgetary impact and is factored into obligations and outlays when <em>it is positive</em></strong>. Subsidy costs can be positive (indicating that the government is likely to lose money on the loan) or negative (indicating that the government is likely to make money on the loan). Loan Subsidy Cost should never be larger in absolute value terms than the Face Value of Loans itself. Administrative costs of running the loan or loan guarantee program itself are excluded from Loan Subsidy Cost calculations.

                                            In order to understand the data surfaced in the &quot;Award Spending&quot; sections (detailed below), it is important to understand the concept of <strong>linking between Broker File C and FPDS/FABS award data</strong>. Broker File C serves as a bridge between data sourced from agency financial systems (i.e., the data in Broker File C itself) and award data sourced from FPDS and FABS. The actual link between these two datasets is an <strong>award ID</strong> (also known as <strong>&quot;award unique key&quot;</strong>). For various reasons, not every award ID in Broker File C has a corresponding award ID in FPDS or FABS data, which makes them unmatchable. If a Broker File C row cannot be matched to FPDS or FABS, we call it &quot;unlinked&quot;. Unlinked Broker File C data cannot be supplemented by metadata from FPDS or FABS (including recipient information, CFDA program, and funding agency).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>The rule of thumb for all award sections is to <em>use complete Broker File C data where possible</em> (containing both linked and unlinked awards); <em>where not possible, only linked data will be used</em> (representing a subset of the authoritative award spending total based on both linked and unlinked data in Broker File C).</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Note that even for sections that only display linked award data, <strong>Broker File C is always the basis for any obligated or outlayed dollar amount displayed for award data</strong>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As mentioned in the &quot;Download Instructions&quot; section above, <strong>linked</strong> data is compiled in the COVID-19 Spending profile page download.

                                            There are several sections devoted to Award Spending. Each &quot;Award Spending&quot; section contains four high-level, boxed calculations. Unlike the &quot;Total Spending by Budget Category&quot; section, these boxed calculations update based on filters chosen (here, award types).

                                            The first of these calculations is a count of an award attribute (such as the count of CFDA programs) that uses <strong>linked</strong> data. Records without an award ID (award unique key) that links across the two datasets will not be counted in these calculations.

                                            The remaining three calculations use <strong>linked</strong> data when a particular award type is selected (i.e., any selection besides &quot;All Awards&quot;). When &quot;All Awards&quot; is selected, they draw on all Broker File C award data (i.e., <strong>linked and unlinked</strong> data) because no linked data points are required.

                                            Across all &quot;Award Spending&quot; sections, <strong>the charts and tables below these four calculations all rely on linked data</strong>. We use linked data here because the award attributes displayed can only be found by linking the two datasets.

                                            The &quot;Recipient Location&quot; tab is based on &quot;Recipient Location&quot; data. There is currently no &quot;Primary Place of Performance&quot; data used on the profile page, though it is available in the &quot;Award Summaries&quot; files in the profile page download. Recipient Location is the legal business address of the recipient; Primary Place of Performance refers to where the work of an award is performed as determined by federal award reporting officers.

                                            Note that CFDA Programs apply only to financial assistance awards; the CFDA section of the profile page therefore excludes all contract data. If you are looking for CFDA information in the profile page download, see the &quot;Assistance Prime Award Summaries&quot; file.

                                                        The count of recipients in this section represents the number of distinct recipient names in the dataset. Because some names are anonymized or indicate that the associated award was aggregated from many individual recipients/awards to protect personally identifiable information (PII), the true count of recipients is likely significantly higher. Names that indicate anonymized or aggregated recipients include: Multiple Recipients, Multiple Foreign Recipients, Miscellaneous Foreign Awardees, Private Individual, Individual Recipient, and Redacted Due to PII.
