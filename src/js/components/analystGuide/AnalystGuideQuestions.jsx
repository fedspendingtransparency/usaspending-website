        answer: (<>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">The value of award and account spending (except for loans) is measured by obligations and outlays. The value of loans is measured using loan subsidy cost.</p>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">An obligation is a promise made by the government to spend funds. An agency incurs an obligation when it takes an action that requires it to make a payment such as placing an order, signing a contract, awarding a grant, or purchasing a service. Negative obligations, or de-obligations, occur when agencies decrease previous obligations to correct errors or to reflect new information. A de-obligation may be issued when the price of a project was lower than expected.</p>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">An outlay occurs when money is actually paid out. </p>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">Loan subsidy cost is an estimation made by the government of what a loan will cost over time. </p>

            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">The federal government uses financial assistance spending to transfer money (or in-kind resources) to a non-federal entity to serve a public purpose as defined by Congress. The federal government uses contract spending to purchase the goods and services required to fulfill agencies’ public duties. </p>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">For example, the Federal Highway Administration uses financial assistance spending to provide funds to states for public roads while the Air Force uses contract spending to acquire fighter jets to execute its mission.</p>

        question: "How is the value of a loan measured?",
        answer: (<>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">There are two data elements used to measure the value of a loan: the face value of the loan and the loan subsidy cost. The face value of a loan is the total amount of the loan. The loan subsidy cost is the government’s estimate of the loan’s likely cost to the government, in net present value terms. Because federal loans are expected to be repaid, the face value of a loan is not considered federal spending (and for loan guarantees, the face value is not even directly provided by the government, but instead from a third-party financial institution).</p>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">Loan subsidy cost is calculated based on a credit model specific to the program and, in some cases, the recipient’s characteristics or credit history. Loan subsidy cost allows the government to budget for potential defaults on loans. </p>

Administrative costs of running the loan or loan guarantee program are excluded from loan subsidy cost calculations.</p>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">Loan subsidy costs can be positive, negative, or zero depending on whether the government expects to lose money, gain money, or break even on a loan. The loan subsidy cost of a loan should never be larger in absolute value than the face value of the loan. </p>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">When loan subsidy cost is updated to reflect the outcome or current state of loans, agency budgets more accurately reflect resources used for loans.</p>

        answer: (<>
            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">Currently, it’s uncommon for agencies to update loans with corrections to the base record or by adding a modification record. As a result, the face value and subsidy cost data on USAspending generally only reflect the reality at the time of initial reporting. If the face value of the loan is modified during its life (such as if the loan principal is later expanded or the recipient returns part of the original loan), this will generally not be reflected in the data. If the risk profile of a recipient changes, up to and including if they completely default on the loan, this will generally not be reflected in the data. If the loan is forgiven, this will generally not be reflected in the data either. Consequently, loan spending data are generally less accurate than that of other award types.</p>

                <li className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">Allocation Transfer Agency ID (ATA): 3 digits that identify the agency that receives funds through an allocation (non-expenditure) transfer.</li>

Federal accounts are found in the budget that the President submits to Congress for approval.</p>

            <p className="analyst-guide__answerStyle">Federal accounts are comprised of a TAS or multiple TASs. You can understand their relationship using the analogy of a bank account. Say you have a bank account, and in that account, you have checking, growth, and savings accounts. In this scenario, your bank account is the federal account, and the checking, growth, and savings accounts are your TASs. Checking, growth, and savings accounts have different purposes and are at the level where transactions take place. These “TASs” would be grouped under your account based on your Social Security Number, in the same way that a federal account is based on a Federal Account Symbol. Just like checking, growth, and savings accounts, the Student Financial Assistance federal account has several related TASs that have different obligation amounts.</p>

When this occurs, quite often the executing agency will submit the financial and award information associated with the TAS. Since the funding was assigned by Congress to the agency indicated by the Agency Identifier, we group by Agency Identifier so that users can see both the budgetary resources assigned to the agency as well as the spending that flows from the related accounts.</p>
