               This section displays the awards that have been made under
               this Indefinite Delivery Vehicle (IDV). IDV contracts are
               a special kind of contract which aren&apos;t directly
               associated with award amounts. This is because IDV
               contracts merely act as a means, or vehicle, for agencies
               to procure an indefinite amount of goods and services from
               vendors within a specific time frame. For this reason, the
               awards made under the IDV are where the agency&apos;s
               spending actually occurs, not the IDV itself. The awards
               under an IDV are sometimes known or referred to as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Task Order</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Delivery Order</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Purchase Order</strong>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>
               Calls The awards under an IDV can also sometimes be yet
               another IDV. We show both IDV contracts and (non-IDV)
               contracts made under this IDV in the two tabs below,
               respectively.
