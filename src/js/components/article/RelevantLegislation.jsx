                        Beta.USAspending.gov is the new official source of accessible, searchable
                        and reliable spending data for the U.S. Government. Treasury released this
                        new version of the USAspending.gov site in accordance with the Digital
                        Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) of 2014 requirements.

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <p>
                        The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA)
                        was signed into law on September 26, 2006. The legislation required that
                        federal contract, grant, loan, and other financial assistance awards of
                        more than $25,000 be displayed on a publicly accessible and searchable
                        website to give the American public access to information on how their tax
                        dollars are being spent. In 2008, FFATA was amended by the Government
                        Funding Transparency Act, which required prime recipients to report details
                        on their first-tier sub-recipients for awards made as of October 1, 2010.

                    <p>
                        The transparency efforts of FFATA were expanded with the enactment of the
                        Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) Pub. L. 113-101 on
                        May 9, 2014. The purpose of the DATA Act, as directed by Congress, is to:

                            Expand FFATA by disclosing direct agency expenditures and linking
                            federal contract, loan, and grant spending information to federal agency
                            programs
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Establish government-wide data standards for financial data and provide
                            consistent, reliable, and searchable data that is displayed accurately
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            compliance costs, while improving transparency

                            Improve the quality of data submitted to USAspending.gov by holding
