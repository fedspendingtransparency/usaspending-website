                            The Data Broker is the system that collects and validates federal spending
                            data from source systems before they are ultimately published on USAspending.gov.
                            It receives data through two processes: one process is for FABS (i.e., transaction-level
                            financial assistance data) and one process is for monthly compilations and quarterly
                            certifications of Files A, B, C, D1, D2, E, and F. Data from the FABS process generates
                            File D2. Both processes involve data validation checks within the Data Broker.
                            The results of some validation checks prevent publication of data, while others
                            raise warnings without preventing publication. Auditors can review these results
                            to monitor agency submissions.

                                The Data Broker validates the data it receives from agency financial systems (Files A, B, and C) as well as FABS. These validations are based on business rules (such as for award linkage between File C and Files D1 and D2) and checks against authoritative sources such as GTAS. Agency financial systems are subject to other data quality assurance measures, such as review by Offices of Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for reports as required by the DATA Act.
                                    </p>

                                USAspending.gov relies on internal validations of data within source systems outside of the Treasury Department (such as FPDS, FSRS, and SAM.gov). The data extracted from these systems may not always align with the data standards, definitions, and requirements established in guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Treasury Department.
