                    Active filters in Award Search use Boolean Operators, which are simple words (AND, OR) used to combine or exclude keywords in order to limit or modify search results. When selecting from the categories of filters in Award Search (e.g., “Time Period”, “Location” or “Recipient Type”), these operators function differently depending on whether you have selected multiple filters from within the same category (e.g., searching for spending to multiple states under the Location category), or across categories (e.g., searching for award spending in one location to one type of recipient).
                    </p>
                    <p className="filter-modal__top-description-2">
                    Generally, active filters within the same category function as an OR, while active filters across categories function as an AND. There are also some filters which search to see if the selected value is included within an award summary using INCLUDES or IN operators.
