                        The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA)
                        was signed into law on September 26, 2006. The legislation required that
                        federal contract, grant, loan, and other financial assistance awards of
                        more than $25,000 be displayed on a publicly accessible and searchable
                        website to give the American public access to information on how their
                        tax dollars are being spent. In 2008, FFATA was amended by the Government
                        Funding Transparency Act, which required prime recipients to report
                        details on their first-tier sub-recipients for awards made as of
                        October 1, 2010.

                        The transparency efforts of FFATA were expanded with the enactment of
                        the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) Pub. L.
                        113-101 on May 9, 2014. The purpose of the DATA Act, as directed
                        by Congress, is to:

                            Expand FFATA by disclosing direct agency expenditures and linking
                            federal contract, loan, and grant spending information to federal
                            agency programs

                            Establish government-wide data standards for financial data and
                            provide consistent, reliable, and searchable data that is displayed
                            accurately
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Simplify reporting, streamline reporting requirements, and reduce
                            compliance costs, while improving transparency
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Improve the quality of data submitted to USAspending.gov by holding
                            agencies accountable.
