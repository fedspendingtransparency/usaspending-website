                From a budget perspective, loan face value is not considered Federal spending, since it does not in itself represent a long-term cost to the government. As a result, loan face value dollars <u>are not</u> included in the Total Awarded Amount figure above or any other part of this page where dollar amounts appear.
            </p>
            <p>
                What <u>is</u> included from a loan perspective in Total Awarded Amount and the other dollar figures is the loan subsidy cost, which <u>is</u> considered actual budgetary federal spending. Subsidy cost is the calculated net present value of the loan or loan guarantee to the government, taking into account the size of the loan (face value), interest rate, and the modeled risk of the recipient failing to pay back the loan in part or full; subsidy cost can be positive (indicating that the government is likely to lose money on the loan) or negative (indicating that the government is likely to make money on the loan). Subsidy cost should never be larger in absolute value terms than the face value itself. Administrative costs of running the loan or loan guarantee program itself are excluded from subsidy cost calculations.
            </p>
            <p>
                As stated above, all subsidy costs associated with loans tied to this state (via the place of performance fields) during the filtered time period are captured within the &quot;Total Awarded Amount&quot; number above and anywhere else on this page dollar amounts are mentioned.
